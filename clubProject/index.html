            <h2>What is Melee?</h2>
            <p>
                Super Smash Brothers Melee is a competitive platform fighting game for the Nintendo Gamecube.
                It was originally meant to be a party game that casual players could enjoy, but the depth of 
                mechanics and advanced techniques lead to the creation of a diehard competitive scene.

            <h2>How do I get started?</h2>
            <p>
                There are many ways to get started with learning Melee, although it must be noted that
                Melee is not the most beginner friendly game and players will need to invest some time practicing
                before they get the hang of it.
